## Why download Aspsoe.Page for C++?

[Aspose.Page for C++](https://products.aspose.com/page/cpp/) is an on premise C++ API that allows you to add XPS manipulation features to your own applications. The API also supports converting XPS, EPS & PS documents to other formats.

## XPS Processing Features

- Create and [edit `XPS` documents](https://docs.aspose.com/page/cpp/add-text-in-xps-document/).
- Add or remove [pages of `XPS` document](https://docs.aspose.com/page/cpp/add-pages-to-xps-document/).
- Create vector graphics shapes (Path element) using a set of primitives (elliptical arcs, Bezier curve segments, and straight-line segments).
- Create text strings (Glyphs element).
- Group elements (Canvas element) to manipulate a group as a whole.
- [Supports brushes of various types](https://docs.aspose.com/page/cpp/add-grid-using-visual-brush/), such as solid color brush, image brush, visual brush, etc.
- Supports different color spaces including `sRGB`, `scRGB`, and any space-based on `ICC` profile.
- Works for multiple documents inside an `XPS` document.
- Add default print tickets into the new `XPS` document or preserve print tickets in opened `XPS`.
- Save `XPS` documents in various [supported file formats](https://docs.aspose.com/page/cpp/supported-file-formats/).
