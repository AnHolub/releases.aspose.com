      <h4>Description</h4><div class="HTMLDescription">Agatha, the leading provider of document and quality management systems for Hospitals, Pharmaceutical companies and life-science companies, needed to manage renditions of Microsoft Word documents to PDF so that Agatha clients could review or finalize their documentation as PDF. Since the Asia market represents an important part of AgathaÃ¢ÂÂs business, it was critical that the solution supports accurate PDF conversion of documents written not only in English but also in Japanese and Chinese.</div>
