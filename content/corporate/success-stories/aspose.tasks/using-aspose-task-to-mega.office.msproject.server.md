      <h4>Description</h4><div class="HTMLDescription">Mega Sistemas needed to to read and write data to MPP files, but as they controlled the construction of large buildings, the MPP files could have more than 7000 tasks and 5000 resources. By using Aspose.Tasks for .NET they got a system which was simpler to maintain, simple to deploy, and offered good value for money to their clients.</div>
